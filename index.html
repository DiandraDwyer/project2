                  <p class = "section1-paragraph">
                     For any hair care regimen, it’s important to understand your <span style = "font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">hair texture</span>, or how straight, curly or kinky your hair is. Different hair textures require different hair care routines! 
                  </p>
                  <p class = "section1-paragraph">
                     This is important because the more curly your hair texture, the less your scalp’s natural oils will slide down your hair strands and moisturize them. This means, the curlier your hair is, the more your hair will need to be moisturized. </p>
